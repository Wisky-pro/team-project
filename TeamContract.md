# Team Contract

---
## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

* Our team will be using Discord as main method of communication. In case of urgency, we will attempt to contact by phone.

* Every Group member is required to check the discord group chat at least once a day, and is responsible to catch up with any missed chat. Important information will be pinned in the group chat as well as mention with discord's (@) feature. 

* Reasonable deadline will be assigned to every task. Group member who is in charge of that task is expected to complete the task on time. If that person cannot complete the task due to factor outside of control, please notify the group member by mentioning everyone in discord group chat and discuss future plans. Otherwise, any late submission will be documented and provided to the CSC207 teaching team if needed.

* Respectful and inclusive behaviour are necessary for smooth and productive communication. Please be respectful when talking to group member online & in person. Any kind of harassment and discrimination is not allowed and will be reported immediately to the CSC207 teaching team.

### Other note

* Based on your previous teamwork experiences, what other behaviours do you agree upon as a team?
    - We should split the work into smaller chunk with finer deadline so everybody can stay on task. 
    - We should meet in person outside of class every 2 weeks to discuss the project. Each meeting is around 30min and can be extended if needed. Team member are expected to attend this meeting. Absence from the meeting will be recorded.

## Decision Making

* Major decision will be made by voting in discord group chat. Smaller decision that does not affect everybody should be discussed privately.

---
## Conflict resolution

* In case conflict arise, any matter should be discussed in the discord group chat and should be resolved by voting. If it cannot be resolved within the group it should be taken to the CSC207 teaching team for assistant.  

---

## Accountability

* Everybody is expected to complete their work on time. If someone repeatedly fails to complete their work, their role will be redistributed to others and reported to the CSC207 teaching team.
* It is important that everybody complete their task on time. This project will have many inter-dependent work that will be heavily affected by missed deadline.
